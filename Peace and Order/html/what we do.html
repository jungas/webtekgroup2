		<p>The Peace and Order Committee itself patrols the barangay in order to monitor the barangay. Monitoring the Barangay is one way to achieve peace and order in the barangay.</p>
		
		<h2 id="cctv">CCTV</h2>
		<p>Monitoring the barangay using CCTV is one of the most appropriate way to do so. Using CCTV, unforeseen events may be captured. It is also a good way to monitor the barangay in case there are no barangay officials currently in patrol. In Barangay New Lucban, there are currently 16 CCTVs installed around the 7 Puroks of the barangay. The Barangay aims to increase the numbers of CCTVs to 24 CCTVs/</p>

		<h2 id="curfew">Curfew</h2>
		<p>Curfew for minors is one aspect in order to achieve peace and order in the community. Curfew is implemented in the barangay to avoid disturbances at night and much worse kidnaps and holdups at night. In Barangay New Lucban, the curfew hours for minors is from 7:00 PM until 5:00 AM. This is to ensure that the barangay is in order since in those times of the day, it is usually dark in which criminals can easily move unnoticed.</p>
		
		<h2 id="criminality">Criminality Rate</h2>
		<p>Criminality rate is usually used to measure if a barangay is in peace and order. According to John B. Caluza, the barangay Captain of New Lucban, the criminality rate of the barangay, as of now, is at 0%. The barangay aims to maintain this rate in the future.</p>
		
		<h2 id="drugs">Drugs</h2>
		<p>Spotting drug users and drug pushers is one of the hardest job of the officials. It's inevitable that there are drug addicts in the community today. In new Lucban as of now, the Barangay Officials sinita 10 drug users in the barangay. It is the aim of the barangay to completely rehabilitate the durg users in order to maintain peace and order.</p>
		
		<h2 id="parking">Illegal Parking</h2>
		<p>Illegal Parking is one of the biggest problems in the barangay, not only in New Lucban but also in other places. The barangay officials make use of the paging system in order to call for those people who are parking illegally. Punishments are also given to those who parked illegally.</p>
