Surveys reveal that people with disabilities consistently report a good quality of life,<br> 
says Tom Shakespeare. So why is it often assumed they are unhappy?<br> 
Have you ever thought to yourself:<br>  
"I'd rather be dead than disabled?" It's not an unusual reflection.<br>  
Disability, in everyday thought, is associated with failure,<br>  
with dependency and with not being able to do things.<br>  
We feel sorry for disabled people, because we imagine it must be miserable to be disabled.<br> 
But in fact we're wrong. It's sometimes called the "disability paradox".<br>  
Surveys reveal people with disabilities consistently report a quality of life as good as,<br>  
or sometimes even better than, that of non-disabled people.<br>
